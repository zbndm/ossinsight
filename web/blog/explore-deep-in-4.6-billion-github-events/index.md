4.6 billion is literally an astronomical figure. The richest star map of our galaxy, brought by Gaia space observatory, includes just under 2 billion stars. What does a view of 4.6 billion GitHub events really look like? What secrets and values can be discovered in such an enormous amount of data? 

Here you go: [OSSInsight.io](https://ossinsight.io/)** can help you find the answer**. It’s a useful insight tool that can give you the most updated open source intelligence, and help you deeply understand any single GitHub project or quickly compare any two projects by digging deep into 4.6 billion GitHub events in real time. Here are some ways you can play with it.

## Compare any two GitHub projects

Do you wonder how different projects have performed and developed over time? Which project is worthy of more attention? **[OSSInsight.io](https://ossinsight.io/)** can answer your questions via the [Compare Projects](https://ossinsight.io/analyze/pingcap/tidb) page.

Let’s take the [Kubernetes repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes)  (K8s) and Docker’s [Moby repository](https://github.com/moby/moby) as examples and compare them in terms of popularity and coding vitality. 


### **Popularity**

To compare the popularity of two repositories, we use multiple metrics including the number of stars, the growth trend of stars over time, and stargazers’ geographic and employment distribution. 

#### **Number of stars**

The line chart below shows the accumulated number of stars of K8s and Moby each year. According to the chart, Moby was ahead of K8s until late 2019. The star growth of Moby slowed after 2017 while K8s has kept a steady growth pace.

#### **Geographical distribution of stargazers**

The map below shows the stargazers’ geographical distribution of Moby and K8s. As you can see, their stargazers are scattered around the world with the majority coming from the US, Europe, and China.

#### **Employment distribution of stargazers**

The chart below shows the stargazers’ employment of K8s (red) and Moby (dark blue). Both of their stargazers work in a wide range of industries, and most come from leading dotcom companies such as Google, Tencent, and Microsoft. The difference is that the top two companies of K8s’ stargazers are  Google and Microsoft from the US, while Moby’s top two followers are Tencent and Alibaba from China.

### **Coding vitality**

To compare the coding vitality of two GitHub projects, we use many metrics including the growth trend of pull requests (PRs), the monthly number of PRs, commits and pushes, and the heat map of developers’ contribution time.  

#### **Number of commits and pushes**

The bar chart below shows the number of commits and pushes submitted to K8s (top) and Moby (bottom) each month after their inception. Generally speaking, K8s has more pushes and commits than Moby, and their number grew stably until 2020 followed by a slowdown afterwards. Moby’s monthly pushes and commits had a minor growth between 2015 and 2017, and then barely increased after 2018.

<center><em>The monthly pushes and commits of K8s (top) and Moby (bottom)</em></center>

#### **Number of PRs**

The charts below show the monthly and accumulated number of PRs of the two repositories. As you can see, K8s has received stable and consistent PR contributions ever since its inception and its accumulated number of PRs has also grown steadily. Moby had vibrant PR submissions before late 2017, but started to drop afterwards. Its accumulated number of PRs reached a plateau in 2017, which has remained the case ever since. 

![](./monthly-and-accumulated-pr-number.png)


<center><em>The monthly and accumulated PR number of K8s (top) and Moby (bottom)</em></center>

#### **Developers’ contribution time**

The following heat map shows developers’ contribution time for K8s (left) and Moby (right). Each square represents one hour in a day. The darker the color, the more contributions occur during that time. K8s has many more dark parts than Moby, and K8s’ contributions occur almost 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. K8s definitely has more dynamic coding activities than Moby.

<center><em>Heat map of developers’ contribution time of K8s (left) and Moby (right)</em></center>

<br />

**Taken together**, these metrics show that while both K8s and Moby are popular across industries world-wide, K8s has more vibrant coding activities than Moby. K8s is continuously gaining popularity and coding vitality while Moby is falling in both over time.

Popularity and coding vitality are just two dimensions to compare repositories. If you want to discover more insights or compare other projects you are interested in, feel free to visit the [Compare](https://ossinsight.io/analyze/pingcap/tidb) page and explore it for yourself.  

Of course, you can use this same page to **deeply explore any single GitHub project** and gain the most up-to-date insights about them. The key metrics and the corresponding changes are presented in a panoramic view. More in-depth analytics such as code changes by PR size groups and PR lines are also available. Explore it for yourself and you’d be surprised. Have fun.

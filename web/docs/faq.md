## Where does these data come from?

* Historical Data: http://gharchive.org/
* Realtime Data: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/activity/events#list-public-events

## Why the stars(or other metrics) on this site is different from that on GitHub?

2 reasons:
* GitHub /events api only publish WatchEvent(this means star), there is no UnWatchEvent;
* GitHub would lost data if there services were down;

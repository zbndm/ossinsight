GitHub was launched in April 2008, and the /events api was published in Feb 2011, so there is a big amount of both historical and realtime data.

## 1. Historical GitHub events

We can't fetch the historical data from GitHub /events api, but fortunately, they were archived by [GH Archive](https://gharchive.org).

GitHub provides 20+ event types, which range from new commits and fork events, to opening new tickets, commenting, and adding members to a project. These events are aggregated into hourly archives, which you can access with any HTTP client:

| Query | Downloadable Files |
| ---- | ---- |
| Activity for 1/1/2015 @ 3PM UTC |	`https://data.gharchive.org/2015-01-01-15.json.gz` |
| Activity for 1/1/2015 | `https://data.gharchive.org/2015-01-01-{0..23}.json.gz` |
| Activity for all of January 2015 | `https://data.gharchive.org/2015-01-{01..31}-{0..23}.json.gz` |


## 2. Realtime GitHub events

According to [GitHub Events API Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/activity/events), the realtime /events api looks like this:

```bash
curl \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  -H "Authorization: token <TOKEN>" \
  https://api.github.com/events
```

`<TOKEN>` means `personal access token`, it can be used in api requests or `git clone/push` instead of password & [2FA](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/about-two-factor-authentication) code.

### Creating a personal access token

You can learn how to generate one by reading: [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). Or just click [this link](https://github.com/settings/tokens) to generate your personal access token quickly, before that you **MUST SHOULD** know:

**Note**: _Save token to somewhere because you will never see it after closing the tab._

:::caution
There is no need to grant any privilege to this token, that means, leave all checkbox UNCHECKED in the `Select scopes` section.

In addition, zero privilege is safe enough.

If you want to build **Another Insight** tool that analyzes data from a source rather than GitHub, then you're in the right place. This workshop will teach you that it's not too hard to get insights from big data expecially **big data with real-time inserts and updates**.

## What you will learn

### 1. Methodology to setup an insight system

Usually, with enough abstraction, there will be 3 steps to setup an insight system like OSS Insight:

1. Find the data source (both historical and real-time data).
2. Load data to TiDB (or any other HTAP database).
3. Get insights with SQL.

### 2. Knowledge about HTAP database

It‚Äôs best to run your insight tool on a [Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing(HTAP)](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/dev/explore-htap) database. It is **SUPER EASY** to handle both:
* Acting as a **primary** RDBMS to _<u>serve requests in high concurrency</u>_ and _<u>insert/update in realtime</u>_
* Provide _<u>analytical ability to get insights</u>_

We have a 10-minute blog post that explains [why we choose TiDB to support OSSInsight](/blog/why-we-choose-tidb-to-support-ossinsight). But to save you some time, the following diagram shows the architectural differences "before" and "after" we use TiDB:

</center>
<center><i>Before and after we use TiDB</i></center>

Using this architecture means that we don‚Äôt need to learn  traditional `big data` skills such as: MySQL+sharding technologies -> industrial etl tools -> olap databases->MySQL(write back), and then setup/manage these infrastructures, but just get a `T+1` analysis result finally.

:::info
You can load data to MySQL instead of TiDB; however, you will have performance issues.

## Join a Workshop!

We have implemented the `mini OSS Insights` workshop and are thinking about creating three other workshops. You can try them by yourself with their historical and real-time API (a bit of a challenge, but not too hard :-).

* [Mini OSS Insight](/docs/workshop/mini-ossinsight/introduction)
* [NFT Insight](/docs/workshop/nft-insight)
* [Hacker News Insight](https://hackernews-insight.vercel.app/)
* [Twitter Insight](/docs/workshop/twitter-insight) _Not ready_
* [Stack Overflow Insight](/docs/workshop/stackoverflow-insight) _Not ready_

If you want a further talk about OSS Insight, please join our offline workshop, you may get help there:
